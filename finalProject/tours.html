         <h2>San Miguel de Cozumel</h2>
        <p>
            San Miguel de Cozumel is the largest city in Cozumel 
            Municipality in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. With a 2010 census population of 77,236 persons, it is 
            also Quintana Roo's fourth-largest community, after Canc√∫n, Chetumal, and Playa del Carmen.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is a hub for 
            tourism on the Riviera Maya, providing the sole ferries between the Mexican mainland and the island. In addition 
            to the ferry service to Playa del Carmen, the first international cruise terminal in Quintana Roo is located 
            in the city.

        <h2>Arrecifes de Cozumel National Park</h2>
        <p>
            The Arrecifes de Cozumel National Park is off the coast of the island of Cozumel in the state of Quintana Roo, 
            Mexico. The Cozumel reef system is part of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, the second largest coral reef 
            system in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even though almost the entire island of Cozumel is surrounded by coral reefs, the park 
            only encompasses the reefs on the south side of the island. It begins just south of the International Pier and 
            continues down and around Punta Sur and up just a small portion of the east side of the island. The park contains 
            both shallow and mesophotic coral reefs and extends to the 100 m depth isobar.

        <h2>El Cedral</h2>
        <p>
            El Cedral is a gorgeous little village covered in colorful flags and souvenir shops. 
            The ruins are 1500 years old, and the town is named for the cedar trees that grow in the area and all over the 
            ruins. Martinez was very friendly, and his shop is worth visiting!
        </p>

        <p>
            El Cedral is the oldest Mayan Ruins on Cozumel Island, dating back to 800 A.D.  The Mayan village was once the 
            capital of Cozumel, and the largest community on the island.  It was discovered by Spanish Conquistadors in 1518, 
            who tore down much of the Mayan temple, and then during World War II, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers destroyed 
            more of it to make way for the island's first airport.
